# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms in Java

This folder contains my **DSA practice solutions**, organized topic-wise.  
Each file includes the problem name, approach, and time/space complexity.  

---

## 📂 Folder Structure
- **Arrays/** → Problems on arrays (searching, sorting, prefix sums, etc.)
- **Lists/** → Linked list problems (singly, doubly, circular, operations)
- **Queues/** → Queue, deque, circular queue, priority queue problems
- **Stacks/** → Stack operations, expression evaluation, monotonic stacks
- **Trees/** → Binary trees, BSTs, traversals, recursive & iterative solutions

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking
- Arrays → 24 problems solved  
- Lists → 11 problems solved  
- Queues → 6 problems solved  
- Stacks → 14 problems solved  
- Trees → Currently solving (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder done)  
- Next Topic → Graphs  

---

## 📝 Notes
- All solutions are written in **Java**.  
- File naming convention: `Topic_ProblemName.java`  
- Each solution contains:
  - Problem reference (e.g., LeetCode #94)
  - Approach used (Recursive, Iterative, BFS, DFS, etc.)
  - Time & space complexity  

---

## 🚀 Upcoming
- Graphs (BFS, DFS, shortest paths, MST)  
- Dynamic Programming (tabulation, memoization)  
- Advanced problems (heaps, maps, tries)
